              BeliefSat is a 2p-PocketQube standard student nano-satellite being
              developed by the undergraduate students of K.J.Somaiya Institute
              of Engineering and Information Technology, Sion, Mumbai. The
              satellite itself is a sub-part of team’s proposal under
              PS4-Orbital platform program of ISRO, wherein, team aims to
              demonstrate indegenously developed technologies for PocketQube
              standard nano-satellites. As a part of this demonstration,
              BeliefSat will be launched out of SomaiyaPod which is a Pocketqube
              standard deployer being indegenously developed at the institute.
              The unique construction technique, combination of COTS components
              for communication, on-board computer and power sub-systems ,
              together constitute of SomaiyaPQBus, around which the satellite is
              being made, is also one of the technologies that the team wants to
              demonstrate and open-source to enable use by future missions.

              I have worked on building the firmware from scratch for the
              satellite. We have used Arduino Uno. Many of the libraries of
              sensors had to be optimized. I along with my team are wholly
              responsible for the firmware of the satellite. As we have limited
              space, we plan to avoid using libraries and abstraction wherever
              possible The satellite’s launch and work has been delayed due to
              the pandemic. Check out the github repo for full information.
